I am a master's graduate from the University of Bonn. I wrote my [master thesis](http://baj31415.github.io/files/2024bajpaimsc.pdf) at the [Photogrammetry and Robotics Lab](https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/index.html) with [Dr. Marija Popović](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=XON8iQoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Prof. Dr. Cyrill Stachniss](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=8vib2lAAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) in the area of vision language model based perception, uncertainty quantification, metric-semantic mapping and planning for household robots. Before that, I spent a semester working on robotics simulation, RL and sim2real at the Embodied AI team at [Huawei Munich](https://huaweiresearchcentergermanyaustria.teamtailor.com/departments/intelligent-cloud-technologies-laboratory). Before coming to Germany, I worked as a founding employee and assistant manager of the robotics focused VC and startup accelerator [IHFC](https://www.ihfc.co.in/). Previously to which, I worked on model predictive control as an intern at IIT Delhi with [Prof. S.K. Saha](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=9Td4hFMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), which followed over from my work on building delivery drones at [SRMUAV](https://www.youtube.com/@srmuav3921).

I am passionate about working on architectures for perception, representation learning and decision making tasks. My current research interests revolve around reinforcement learning, generative models, differentiable simulation, interpretability and neuro-inspired AI architectures. 

Currently seeking research roles in the AI/Robotics space.
