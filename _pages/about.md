I am a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Doctoral Candidate working on the [AIGreenBots](https://aigreenbots.eu) EU project at the Georgia Tech–CNRS International Research Lab IRL2968 [(Dreamlab)](https://dream.georgiatech-metz.fr), France. I'm advised by [Dr.Stéphanie Aravecchia](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tzDLDw8AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Cédric Pradalier](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4_1DZoYAAAAJ&hl=en). 

I earned my master's degree from the University of Bonn where I majored in Mobile Sensing and Robotics . I wrote my [master thesis](http://baj31415.github.io/files/2024bajpaimsc.pdf) at the [Photogrammetry and Robotics Lab](https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/index.html) with [Dr. Marija Popović](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=XON8iQoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Prof. Dr. Cyrill Stachniss](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=8vib2lAAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) in the area of vision language model based perception, uncertainty quantification, metric-semantic mapping and planning for household robots. During my master's I also spent a semester working on robotics simulation, RL and sim2real at the Embodied AI team at [Huawei Munich](https://huaweiresearchcentergermanyaustria.teamtailor.com/departments/intelligent-cloud-technologies-laboratory). 

Previously, I worked as a founding employee and assistant manager of the robotics focused VC and startup accelerator [IHFC](https://www.ihfc.co.in/). Previously to which, I worked on model predictive control as an intern at IIT Delhi with [Prof. S.K. Saha](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=9Td4hFMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), which followed my earlier experience developing delivery drones with [SRMUAV](https://www.youtube.com/@srmuav3921).

I am passionate about working on architectures for perception, representation learning and decision making tasks. My current research interests revolve around reinforcement learning, generative models, interpretability and neuro-inspired AI architectures.
