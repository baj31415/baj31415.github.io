I am a master's graduate from the University of Bonn. I wrote my master thesis at the [Photogrammetry and Robotics Lab](https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/index.html) with Dr. Marija Popović and Prof. Dr. Cyrill Stachniss in the area of vision language model based perception, metric-semantic mapping and planning for household robots. Before that, I spent a semester working on robotics simulation, RL and sim2real at the Embodied AI team at [Huawei Munich](https://huaweiresearchcentergermanyaustria.teamtailor.com/departments/intelligent-cloud-technologies-laboratory). Before coming to Germany, I worked as a founding employee and assistant manager of [IHFC](https://www.ihfc.co.in/), one of the largest robotics focused startup accelerators in India. Previously to which, I worked on model predictive control as an intern at IIT Delhi with Prof. S.K. Saha, which followed over from my work on building delivery drones at [SRMUAV](https://www.youtube.com/@srmuav3921).

I am passionate about working on architectures for cognition and learning in perception, prediction and decision making tasks. I am currently interested in learning more about model based RL, differentiable simulation and neuro-inspired architectures to AI.

Currently seeking research roles that allow me to bring an impact to the AI/Robotics space.
